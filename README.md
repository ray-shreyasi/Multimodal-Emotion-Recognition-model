# Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER)

Our project focuses on **Multimodal Emotion Recognition** by combining **Facial Expression Recognition** and **Speech Emotion Recognition** to improve emotion classification accuracy. The system uses a hybrid deep learning approach with **feature-level fusion** of visual and audio modalities.

## Project Overview:-

Emotion recognition is a key aspect of affective computing. While unimodal systems (like facial expression or speech alone) often suffer from inaccurate results due to dependency on a single data modal, this project improves robustness and accuracy by fusing features from both modalities.

### Key Components:-

- **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)**:
  - CNN-based model trained on FER2013 dataset.
  - Intermediate feature extraction.
  
- **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)**:
  - CNN-based model trained on MFCC and its differentiated features extracted from audio.
  - Intermediate feature extraction.

- **Fusion Strategy**:
  - **Feature-Level Fusion**:
    - Global Average Pooling (GAP) applied to both modalities' extracted intermediate feature.
    - Feature vectors concatenated and passed to a dense neural network for classification.
      
## Working of the Model:-

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Facial images resized and normalized.
   - Audio converted to MFCCs using `librosa` library.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train individual CNN models for FER and SER.
   - Extract intermediate features after convolutional layers.
   - Apply Global Average Pooling on them.
   - Concatenate features and classify via dense layers.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Input facial image and audio file.
   - Output: Emotion label (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.)
